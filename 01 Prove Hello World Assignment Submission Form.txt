This one is straight forward.  You enter the url and it displays the php page with the text hello world.  Nothing fancy. 


4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.

All appears to functioning.  If there is anything you notice let me know immediately.  Everything seems to be testing fine here. 


5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.

Heroku is assume.  I love the fact I can deploying things that are not just static pages for free.  Mind blown. 



6. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:

D - Meets requirements  --Clear this is what I have as of today 9.11.2017.  I might make some improvements before the end of the week to make this more fun.  I set it up so that when I deploy changes to git hub in my master branch they automatically get deployed. 


7. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.

No justification needed.  You asked for a Hello World deployment to Heroku and that is what I have.
